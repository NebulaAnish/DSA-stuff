#Notes
###swapping variables without using any extra variable:
  a=a+b 
  b=a-b #keeps value of a only
  a=a-b # now as b is initial a, so (a-b) puts value of b

###removing duplicates from a sorted array in place:
  using hash map: time complexity goes to: O(N*logN) + O(N)  
  better method: will update soon
